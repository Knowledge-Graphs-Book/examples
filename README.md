# Knowledge graph paper examples

This repository contains examples in concrete syntaxes from the Knowledge Graphs paper (under review for ACM CSUR), along with links to useful resources.

See the extended version of the paper here: [Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02320).

The examples are divided into subsections according to the ACM CSUR version of the paper. To find a particular example you can also search by the name of a particular figure in the repository (e.g., "figure4", "table2", etc.). The examples include comments that indicate where you can try out the examples online, or otherwise where you can find code relating to the example and the discussion it the paper.
